            <p>
                Many travelers skip Manila and make their way to the Philippines' other islands, but a day or two in the country’s capital to go on Manila tours is still highly recommended, especially for those looking for the best places in the Philippines for a family vacation.
                The hustle and bustle aside, Manila features a lot of tourist spots of historical landmarks in the Philippines. One of which is Rizal Park, more commonly known as Luneta.
